Problem:

We would like you to develop an IaC solution to provision a free tier EC2 Amazon Linux instance. The instance should be running Apache server, and the default web site should serve up a page saying “Hello from AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD”, where AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD is the public IP address of the instance. The instance should include a tag, and a security group restricting traffic to port 80 and 22. SSH access should be possible via key-based authentication, but not by password.
 
You should use Terraform for provisioning. You can use Ansible for configuration management if needed, but please do not use AWS-specific techniques such as CloudFormation.
 
Please provide the solution as either a ZIP’ed Git repository, or a link to a public Git repository, if you have an account. If you use a public repository, do not store any credentials, or link the code to Capgemini and its customers in any way (the problem is deliberately designed to be generic to facilitate this
 
=================================================================================

Steps to implement:

1. Install terraform on one of EC2 instance from where you want to run terraform commands.
2. Copy all the files to a specific folder in EC2 instance, i have used winscp to copy quickly. Make sure you replace your own .pem file to connect to EC2.
3. Execute "terraform init" & "terraform apply" commands & run web browser with newly created public ip address.

Challange faced:

Self reflecting is not allowed to get the ip address in aws_instance block, thats why had to go for javascript.
